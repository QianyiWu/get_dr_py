# get_dr_py_API
This package is available for using pybind11 to create get_dr python API.

Deformation Representation Feature (DR Feature) is a kind of fundamental and stable tool in geometry learning area. For more background knowledges and properties of DR feature, we suggest these papers in **Citation** section for further reading. 

# Dependencies
This package depends on <a href='https://www.openmesh.org'>OpenMesh</a> and <a href='http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page'>Eigen</a> libraries. To run the dr computation code, please make sure you have Eigen and OpenMesh precompiled on your computer and modificate the include path in CMakeList.txt file. 

# Usage
We recommend to use cmake to compile this package and a python API will be automatically created to compute DR features.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/QianyiWu/get_dr_py.git
cd get_dr_py
```

After obtaining this repository, run the following code in the repository path:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
You will then get a .so file.
The <a href='https://github.com/QianyiWu/get_dr_py/blob/master/test.py'>test.py</a> with *1_new.obj* and *2_new.obj* could be used for testing.

# Environment Tests
Currently we have fully tested this package on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS environment. Windows and MacOS are not ensured working.
